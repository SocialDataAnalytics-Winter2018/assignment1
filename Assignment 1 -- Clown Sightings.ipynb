    "You're a data journalist with the CBC and you want to do a story about the recent [creepy clown epidemic](http://globalnews.ca/news/2990008/creepy-clown-sightings-why-the-epidemic-is-spreading-across-canada-and-the-u-s/). Like many terrible things which enter Canada, the creepy clown sightings have spread into the country from the United States. The rising clown epidemic is having a series of negative effects: hardworking everyday clowns are having a hard time getting work, children are having more nightmares, and the Canadian Border Services are asking travellers whether or not they have been in contact with clowns if they have travelled into the States recently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your job will be to amalgamate various data about these creepy clown sightings and to report on the various trends you see in the data. You will be working with (made up) data collected by policing agencies across Cananda. There are multiple files which are organized by either province or city."
